- Name lecture files Lecture_{number}.md starting from 1 to comply with Lecture and Homework counting scheme of course site
- If Lecture number is less than 10, use a leading zero before the number

    + This ensures files are sorted in chronological lecture order preventing Lecture_10.md to be sorted before Lecture_5.md
