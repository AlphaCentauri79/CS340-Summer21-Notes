# Lecture 17: Fault Localization
(06/09/2021)

**Defect**
: Static problem that causes undesired behavior

**Fault**
: Runtime crash/error

**Bug**
: Type of defect
- code

## Debugging

**Fault Localization**
: the task of identifying source code regions implicated in a bug

Ex/ Regression test is failing... which lines should we change to fix things?

**How did we localize faults?**
- print statements
- stack tracing - look at the trace generated by a crash
- debugger - step through the code

## Confounding Factors
1. user input could affect behavior
2. observer effect/ "Heisen bugs"
3. localization is not unique
	- many places to fix a bug
	- ex/ Null/None check in caller or callee?
4. code size
	- libpng: 85,000 lines
	- google: 2,000,000,000 lines
	- ex/ bug in libpng - no info and you find it in 1 min:
	- 2,000,000,000 * (1/85,000) = ~23,529 min in google
		- 16 days
		- 1 hour (libpng) = ~2.68 years (google)

## Can We Use Testing + Coverage to Save The Day?

**Reminder**: if we don't cpver/test line x, we can know nothing about that line

Lines covered by failing test -> implicated by bug but: passing tests might cover simmilar lines. What can we do?

Maybe... ignore (rank lower) lines in failing tests that passed other tests... ranking of line "suspiciousness"
